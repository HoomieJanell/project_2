The inspiration for this app was a spontaneous idea to devise a tool that would let somebody both receive information about entertainment events and also form groups with other people interested in attending the same one. To permit connection between the client and server side, tools that were utilized include Express and Sequelize. Without them, it would be more difficult to establish the flow from web page to database and back. 
A principle feature of the app is a search bar for performing calls to an API which notifies you of anything matching the criteria. Present as well is a signup form that takes the provided info and sends it to the database in the form of a new user. Planned from the start but still under development is an option to generate unified clusters of users who could then arrange the terms for meeting up at the event. Also intended is a more robust profile section where you can add and modify details, which then become stored in the database. Even though there's more left to be desired, the process of manufacturing a collection of folders and files working together to lay the foundation for full-stack activity was illuminating and educational.
